### 가사

I'm trying to hold my breath
<br>Let it stay this way
<br>Can't let this moment end
<br>You set off a dream in me
<br>Getting louder now
<br>Can you hear it echoing?
<br>Take my hand
<br>Will you share this with me?
<br>'Cause darling, without you
<br>All the shine of a thousand spotlights
<br>All the stars we steal from the night sky
<br>Will never be enough
<br>Never be enough
<br>Towers of gold are still too little
<br>These hands could hold the world but it'll
<br>Never be enough
<br>Never be enough
<br>For me
<br>Never, never
<br>Never, never
<br>Never, for me
<br>For me
<br>Never enough
<br>Never enough
<br>Never enough
<br>For me
<br>For me
<br>For me
<br>All the shine of a thousand spotlights
<br>All the stars we steal from the night sky
<br>Will never be enough
<br>Never be enough
<br>Towers of gold are still too little
<br>These hands could hold the world but it'll
<br>Never be enough
<br>Never be enough
<br>For me
<br>Never, never
<br>Never, never
<br>Never, for me
<br>For me
<br>Never enough
<br>Never, never
<br>Never enough
<br>Never, never
<br>Never enough
<br>For me
<br>For me
<br>For me
<br>For me
